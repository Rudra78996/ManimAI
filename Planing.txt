Create a Manim animation that teaches the concept of “[TOPIC]” in a clear, step-by-step manner.

1. Start with a title scene displaying the topic name “[TOPIC]” at the center.
2. Introduce the core idea briefly using labeled text and fade-in/fade-out transitions.
3. For visual explanation:
   - Use number lines / coordinate grids (if relevant).
   - Show labeled vectors, equations, or geometric shapes.
   - Highlight important elements using color coding.
   - Animate changes over time using smooth transitions.
4. Include mathematical expressions using LaTeX formatting.
5. Emphasize relationships using arrows, transformation effects, and positioning.
6. Use camera panning and zooming if needed to focus on key details.
7. Ensure the pacing is smooth and not rushed—each step should have time to be digested.
8. End with a summary slide or conclusion that wraps up the key takeaway.
